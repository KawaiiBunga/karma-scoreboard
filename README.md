# karma-scoreboard
Scoreboard designed for Karma DarkRP and built for simple setup and customization


Easily Customizable and simple to setup, with lots of customization options

A constant WIP to add new features

Features:

- Shows Title Name, Kills, Deaths, Rank, and Ping
- Every one of those rows are customizeable, including if they are enabled or not, color, and what they say (All done in configuration.lua)


Things I want to do with this in the future - 

- Show Props
- Mute Button
- Catergorization for jobs
- Maybe admin buttons??? (Not sure)
- Make it look just a little nicer
